                    <p>Dr. Vattikunta can place implants with accuracy and confidence by using 3D CT scanner technology
                        and the utilization of a Surgical Guide.
                        From analysis, through planning and placement, the CT scan allows Dr. Vattikunta's surgical
                        predictability with treatment planning in full 3D with restorative outcomes in mind.
                        The 3D CT scanner allows for a more thorough analysis of bone structure and tooth orientation.
                        This technology gives Dr. Vattikunta the capability to map the course of treatment for surgical
                        placement of the implant and abutment.</p>

                    A periodontist is a dentist who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of problems that affect the gums and other supporting tissues of the teeth. 
                    If you want to keep your teeth for life — a completely reasonable goal in this day and age — you need to make sure the tissues that surround them are also healthy. 
                    Should gum problems arise, you may need periodontal therapy to restore diseased tissues to health. Learn more about Periodontal Disease & Therapy.

            <h4>Treatment of Gum Disease</h4>
            <p>Treating gum disease starts with the removal of any plaque and hardened deposits (tartar or calculus) on the tooth root surfaces. 
                This may be followed by other non-surgical treatments and/or periodontal surgery to remove diseased tissue and restore your mouth to the best possible health.
            </p>
            <h4>Implant Dentistry</h4>
            <p>If you are missing one or more teeth, dental implants offer the comfort and security of a permanent replacement that looks and functions just like your natural teeth. 
                Dental implants also help preserve the tooth-supporting bone in your jaw that deteriorates when even one tooth is lost.
            </p>
            <h4>Gum Grafting</h4>
            <p>If gum recession is affecting your health or your appearance, a routine surgucal procedure called gum grafting may help.
                It involves carefully placing a small amount of new tissue in an area where little or no gum tissue currently exists — 
                typically recommended to prevent further gum recession or to help cover tooth root surfaces that have become exposed. Learn more about <a href="#">Gum Grafting</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Tooth Extractions</h4>
            <p>There are times when it is in your best interest to have a tooth extracted (removed).
                This could be the case for a variety of reasons, including: damage or trauma to the tooth; extensive gum disease; extensive tooth decay; or overcrowding.
