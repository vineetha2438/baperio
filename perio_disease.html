                    <p>Here at Lahari Vattikunta, D.D.S, Periodontics and Dental Implants, we work hard to prevent
                        periodontal disease.
                        <br /><br />
                        Periodontal disease is very common in adults. It is caused by all of the bacteria in our mouth
                        that forms form plaque on our teeth.
                        Without routine brushing and flossing, it continues to build up, forming tartar.
                        <br /><br />
                        People with periodontal disease can have red and swollen gums that often bleed quite easily.
                        It may be hard to eat because their teeth are so sensitive. They may be missing teeth. Some
                        people with periodontal disease have very
                        bad breath.
                    <p>We diagnose periodontal disease by examining your teeth. We also use a probe to look for any problem
                        areas. X-rays are also necessary to diagnose the disease.
                        <br /><br />
                        A good professional cleaning is necessary to remove the tartar from your mouth and underneath your
                        gums. If your periodontal disease is bad, you may need to follow up your brushing and flossing with
                        antibacterial mouthrinse. You may even need to use an antibacterial gel or start on oral antibiotics
                        to help to get rid of the disease. Sometimes surgery is necessary to help with the deep pockets of
                        infection.
                        <br /><br />
                        Once your periodontal disease is under control, good home care with brushing and flossing should
                        help to keep it from coming back.
                        <br /><br />
