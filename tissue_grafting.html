                        At some point in their life, many people will be told by their dentist that they will need a gum
                        graft. A gum graft will protect your teeth from any damaging effects of gum recession. This will
                        help improve the appearance of your smile.
                        <br><br />
                        Gum recession happens when the tissue that surrounds the tooth pulls away from the tooth. This
                        exposes more of the tooth or even the tooth's root. This can cause damage to your supporting
                        bone. Many people do not even realize their gums have receded. This is because it can happen so
                        slowly. This is also one of the reasons it is so important to visit your dentist on a regular
                        basis.
