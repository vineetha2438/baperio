                    <p>Periodontal disease is a serious issue that affects many people's lives. Luckily our experienced
                        periodontists are capable of treating periodontal disease in our patients, a field in which they
                        have rigorous training and education.
                        <br /><br />
                        The cleaning of calculus, or tartar, is a major component of treating periodontal disease.
                        However, changes in the patient's behavior are just as important. Making sure your dental
                        hygiene habits are up to par is critical in the treatment of periodontal disease.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your teeth are meant to last a lifetime, so it is critical to properly care for them. If you have
                        periodontal disease, don't feel hopeless. It is a treatable disease, but one that requires the
                        patient to be aware and active with their dental care. Contact us today to learn more about
                        periodontal disease treatment and how we can care for your dental health.</p>
